//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//Favourite Number
var favnumber = 313;
console.log("Favourite Number:", favnumber);
//In this program, I am showing my favourite number.
//Quote
console.log('Carlos Dominguez once said, "Temporary people give permanent lessons."');
//In this program, I am printing a quote with author name.
